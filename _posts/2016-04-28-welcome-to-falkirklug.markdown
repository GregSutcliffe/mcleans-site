categories:

FalkirkLUG (Linux User Group) is a group that meet monthly for fun techy
discussions, along with a meal and a drink or two. Despite the name, we have
evolved to have talks on eveything from IOS app development to coding C for
embedded devices; from Logstash to technology in tourism. 
  
Falkirklug is free to attend, so come along and see for yourself! We meet on
the 1st Tuesday of every month, at Sportsters Bar in Falkirk. Those coming for
food generally arrive between 6-7pm, ant the talk starts around 7:45pm in the
private room.
